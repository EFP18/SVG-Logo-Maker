# SVG Logo Maker

Command line tool to generate an svg logo and write it to file.

## Usage

- Requires Node v12+. (This app has only been tested on Node 16)
- Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
- Run `node index.js` to start the app.
  - Answer questions to generate a logo.
  - Logo will be written to `logo.svg` in the working directory.
- Run tests with `npm run test`

# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Your Task

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the [Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `SVG` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `green` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:

## Additional Requirements



Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md
.  
├── examples/           // Example svg file(s) created with the app
├── lib/                // Folder for classes or functions
    ├── shapes.js       // Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes
    ├── shapes.test.js  // Jest tests for shapes
    └── more...         // Additional files and tests
├── .gitignore          // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js            // Runs the application using imports from lib/
├── package.json
└── README.md           // App description, link to video, setup and usage instructions           
```

> **Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
The application must include `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes in a parent `Shape` class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a `render()` method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

```js
const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
```

You may need to add additional files in the `lib` folder for handling user input, writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is **optional**.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code
This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 15%

* At least one sample SVG file generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 32%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the SVG logo maker and passing tests must be submitted.

* The `README.md` file must include a link to the walkthrough video.

* The walkthrough video must show all tests passing from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated SVG file, showing the file being opened in the browser. The image in the browser must reflect the choices made by the user (text, shape, and colors).

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

  * Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.

  * The application must have `Triangle`, `Square`, and `Circle` classes.



## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests.

* At least one sample SVG file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
