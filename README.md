  ### Description
  This is a backend app that creates an SVG logo. The app asks the user for some information regarding the text of the logo, as well as color combinations, after which it automatically creates the logo. In the meantime, it checks to make sure a text input has been enter with a value of less than 3 characters, and also that a shape has been selected from the list of options. 

  ### Usage
  A user can run tests on this project by opening VSCode, then right-clicking on the index.js file, selecting Open in Integrated Terminal. At that point, the user first needs to install the jest package by typing `npm i jest -D` and also `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`. After that, they can type `npm run test` to run the pre-made tests on the project, or type `node index.js` to get prompted with the questions and create their logo. The logo is then saved on a file called `logo.svg`. 

  ### Tests
  Using NPM Jest.
