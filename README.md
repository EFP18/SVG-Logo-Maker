Command line tool to generate an svg logo and write it to file.

## Usage

- Requires Node v12+. (This app has only been tested on Node 16)
- Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
- Run `node index.js` to start the app.
  - Answer questions to generate a logo.
  - Logo will be written to `logo.svg` in the working directory.
- Run tests with `npm run test`

# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker


Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.



## Acceptance Criteria


THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```



> **Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
The application must include `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes in a parent `Shape` class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a `render()` method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.




### Deliverables: 15%

* At least one sample SVG file generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 32%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the SVG logo maker and passing tests must be submitted.

* The `README.md` file must include a link to the walkthrough video.

* The walkthrough video must show all tests passing from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated SVG file, showing the file being opened in the browser. The image in the browser must reflect the choices made by the user (text, shape, and colors).

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

  * Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.

  * The application must have `Triangle`, `Square`, and `Circle` classes.



## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests.

* At least one sample SVG file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
